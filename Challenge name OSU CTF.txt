Challenge name: OSU CTF


In the Challenge  we know that there is a person named Natasha Drew want to attend a camp,
but the problem is that here grades aren't good enough
which means we need to hack into the system and change her grades to be able to attend this camp.
The URL will redirect us to a login page. First i used Dirb to see if there is sub-directory we can access it but nothing special.
Then we open BurpSuite to intercept and modify the request sent to the server.
In the login page, firt thing to start with is the SQL injection to see if we can get a successful attack. In the username type admin' OR '1'='1' ;--
We get redirected to another page where we can see the student's grades and the user we logged in is rhonda.daniels
In the elements we can see an important command which is var staf={} which define the user logged in and their role and we can see that the admin name is rhonda daniels
which menas we have admin priviledges. Second thing we get is the data-id which is base64 cryptography and its unique for every student by decoding some id we get the student firstname_lastname.
lets get natasha id by encoding natasha_drew and save it for later on.
The third and important part is that there is a script and we can reach it from /assets/js/app.min.js in there we can clearly read the script.
We can see two functions Setup links and submit form. The first function is to check if the user is admin.
Then we can see how the URL is modified to redirect us to the edit page.
This function add to the URL '/update-'+ objectname+ '/' + this.dataset.id.
The objectname is student and this.dataset.id is the base64 format, for example Brett,Nancie is TmDuYll0JyZXR0.
We add to the URL /update-student/TmDuYll0JyZXR0. Now we can update nancy's grades.
Now lets take the base64 format for natasha drew and replace nancy's ID in the URL now we can modify natasha's grade and we get the FLAG!
